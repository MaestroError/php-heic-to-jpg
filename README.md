## Installation       
*Run command in your project's root directory*
```
composer require maestroerror/php-heic-to-jpg
```

## Usage
Using the class "HeicToJpeg" is extremely simple. You need full location of any HEIC image to pass in "convert" function and call "saveAs" (save as file) or "get" (get file contents) methods.
```php
// 1. save as file
Maestroerror\HeicToJpg::convert("image1.heic")->saveAs("image1.jpg");
// 2. get content (binary) of converted JPG
$jpg = Maestroerror\HeicToJpg::convert("image1.heic")->get();
```
         
#### For MacOS users
It should detect the OS itself, but if you want to specify architecture, it is recommended to use `convertOnMac` instead. The second argument is architecture of your system, by default set as "amd64", but you can specify "arm64" (AArch64, M1)
```php
// By default
Maestroerror\HeicToJpg::convertOnMac("image1.heic", "arm64")->saveAs("image1.jpg");
```

#### isHeic method      
Before converting, you can use the isHeic method (contributed by [pbs-dg](https://github.com/pbs-dg)) to check if a file is HEIC format.
```php
$fileIsHeic = HeicToJpg::isHeic("image.heic");
if ($fileIsHeic) {
    // Your code
}
```
